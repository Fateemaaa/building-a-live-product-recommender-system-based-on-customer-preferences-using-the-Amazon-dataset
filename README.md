Big Data Analytics
Phase 1: Data Processing and Analysis (Marks: 100)
• Load the Amazon product dataset into MongoDB using Apache Spark: In this phase,
you will use Apache Spark to efficiently load the Amazon product dataset into
MongoDB. You will need to consider the schema of the dataset and the structure
of the MongoDB collections to optimize the data loading process. You will also
need to handle any missing or malformed data as part of the data loading process.
(50 Marks)
• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights into the
data: Once the data is loaded into MongoDB, you will perform EDA to gain insights
into the data. You will use tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the
data and identify patterns and trends in the data. You will also use statistical
analysis to identify correlations and relationships in the data. Every one can have
different analysis based on their perception of Data. (40 Marks)
• Preprocess and clean the data as necessary for training the model: After
performing EDA, you will preprocess and clean the data as necessary for training
the recommendation model. This may involve handling missing values,
transforming categorical variables, normalizing the data, and feature engineering.
(10 Marks)

Phase 2: Model Training and Live Streaming (Marks: 150)
• Train a recommendation model using machine learning algorithms on the
preprocessed data: In this phase, you will train a recommendation model using
machine learning algorithms on the preprocessed data. You will use techniques
such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization to
build the model. You will evaluate the model using metrics such as precision,
recall, and F1 score. (50 Marks)
• Set up a Flask-based web application: you will set up a Flask-based web
application. You will use Flask to build the web application and MongoDB to store
the user preferences and recommendations. You will use REST APIs to
communicate between the web application and the recommendation system. (50
Marks)
• Use Apache Kafka to stream real-time recommendations based on user

preferences: Once the model is trained, you will use Apache Kafka to stream real-
time recommendations based on user preferences to the webpage you created

using Flask. (50 Marks)
Overall, this project will give you hands-on experience with big data processing, NoSQL
databases, machine learning, web development, and stream processing. You will also
develop skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication.
